# Dealer Card Scanner Pipeline

This is a Python pipeline for digitizing stamp dealer cards.  
It takes high-resolution scans of 2x2 (or larger) dealer card sheets, crops each card out, runs a Photoshop action for calibration, and applies OCR to extract structured data (condition, year, Scott number, catalog price, and selling price).

## Features

- **Card detection**: Uses OpenCV to find white dealer cards against a black background.
- **Perspective correction**: Crops and warps each card to a straight rectangle.
- **Photoshop integration**: Calls Adobe Photoshop via AppleScript + JSX to run a custom Action (e.g. color/white balance).
- **OCR with Tesseract**: Reads fields from the card (Condition, Year, Scott #, Catalog Price, Selling Price).
- **Structured output**: Produces both `cards_ocr.csv` and `cards_ocr.json`.
- **Batch mode**: Process a single image or an entire folder of JPEGs, with persistent sequential numbering (`card_0001_raw.jpg`, `card_0002_raw.jpg`, â€¦).
- **Debug overlays**: Optional saved images showing detected contours/ROIs for tuning.
